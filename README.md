# QR-scanner-
You can take the Qr code picture on your mobile and show the picture in
front of your webcam. It correctly identifies the QR code that presents on
your screen. And this program redirects you to a link hidden in the QR code.
I use OpenCV , Numpy and pyzbar library in this project.
pyzbar is a python library which is used for QR code scanner and barcode scannse and it supports EAN-13\UPC-A,UPC-E,EAN-8,CODE 128,QR CODE ETC...
